## Personalized Fitness Planner

Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be challenging due to a lack of personalized guidance, inconsistent motivation, and overwhelming fitness and nutrition information. Many existing platforms offer generic plans that fail to consider individual goals, body types, and preferences, making it difficult for users to stay committed and see results.

The Personalized Fitness Planner solves this by providing customized workout and nutrition plans, progress tracking, and motivational support tailored to each user’s needs. Whether someone wants to lose weight, build muscle, or maintain an active lifestyle, our platform bridges the gap between expert guidance and user convenience—empowering individuals to take control of their health in a sustainable, effective, and accessible way.

 ## Setup and Installation Instructions

We begin by ensuring Node.js and npm are installed on the machine. Once inside the project folder, we run npm install to install all required dependencies. The project is built using React and TailwindCSS, with Tailwind already configured through PostCSS. Necessary dependencies like tailwindcss, autoprefixer, and postcss are pre-installed, and we manage styling through the tailwind.config.js and global CSS files. After setup, we launch the development server using npm start and access the application through http://localhost:3000 in the browser.
